# Remly - Adding Augmented Reality to Networking 

An iOS App built to add a layer of augmented reality to business card distribution

## Landing Page

http://remly.tech/ - Built in React

## Problem
Networking through business card distribution is typically an uneventful exchange and recipients have little to zero resources on memory who handed them the card or about the business as a whole. 

## Hypothesis
If we provide an app that allows users to interact with an AR layer on top of the business cards we can reinvent the relationship with business cards and marketing with business cards as a whole so that recipients leave networking events excited to connect and follow-up with new contacts.

## AR Layer Added

## Reflection / Improvements
I would love for users to be able to interact with the AR layer and link buttons to the 3D images that could redirect to a company's individual app or social media profile.
